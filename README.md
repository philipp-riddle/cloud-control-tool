# Cloud Tools (CLI & Web Interface Tools for Cloud File Systems)
Hi there! Nice that you found this repository. This is just me programming a cloud managent and overview system I've always wanted.

## What will this system include?
It will include periodic updating, overview of how the storage changed over time, have overview over which directories take up the most space etc (file and directory analysis).
All that kind of stuff displayed in graphs with the help of charts.js.

## Tech Stack
* Mongo DB
* PHP
* Composer
* Own little framework to make things work

## Why open-source?
I figured that I wanted to contribute more to the open source community and I think it's also nice for others to have access to this software as well.

## Feel free to contribute!
